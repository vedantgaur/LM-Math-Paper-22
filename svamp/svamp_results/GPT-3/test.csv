There is a discount on each pack. So we have to subtract that discount from the price of each pack. 

That means we have to subtract x dollars from w dollars. 

That will give us the new price of each pack.",You would have to pay w - x dollars to buy each pack.,"Let there be p packs in total. 
Each pack costs w dollars, so the total cost is pw dollars. 
There is a discount of x dollars on each pack, so the total discount is px dollars. 

Therefore, the cost of each pack is (w - x) dollars. 

The total cost is p(w - x) dollars.","There are two types of packs, those that cost $2 and those that cost $5. 

There are 4 packs that cost $2. 

This means that the total cost of the $2 packs is $8. 

There are 3 packs that cost $5. 

This means that the total cost of the $5 packs is $15. 

The total cost of all the packs is $8 + $15, which is $23.","There is no set price for packs, as the cost will vary depending on the store or website you purchase them from. However, you can typically expect to pay between $2 and $4 per pack.","There are two types of packs, small and big.
The price of the small pack is $x.
The price of the big pack is $y$.
The big pack contains 5 times as many candies as the small pack.

You need to buy 10 packs.
You can buy either:

2 small packs and 4 big packs. In this case, you need to pay $2x + 4y$.
Or 10 small packs. In this case, you need to pay $10x$.

To find the minimum price, compare the two sums and take the smaller one:

$2x + 4y \leq 10x$

$4y \leq 8x$

$y \leq 2x$",,,,( x - w ),1,( 4.0 - 3.0 )

If he had $x at the start and he spends $w on the candy bar, then he would have left $x-w. 

But we know that he has $w left, so $x-w = w. 

From this we can solve that x=2w and the cost of the candy bar is w.",The candy bar cost $x - $w.,"$x$ - the money he had at the start
$w$ - the money he had left after buying the candy bar
$c$ - the price of the candy bar

We know that:
$$x - c = w$$
$$x - w = c$$
Therefore:
$$c = w - x$$",The candy bar cost $2.65.,The candy bar cost $2.00.,"Suppose there are `x` candy bars. 
Each candy bar costs `c` cents. 
The total cost is `xc`.

0,"Each pack of dvds costs w dollars. 

This means that if we have one pack, it will cost w dollars. 

If we have two packs, it will cost 2w dollars. 

If we have three packs, it will cost 3w dollars.

So if we have one pack, we will pay w - x dollars.

Then, we can introduce a variable for the number of DVDs in a pack. Finally, we can introduce a variable for the total cost of a pack. 

Now we have all the information we need to write our equations. Let's start with the equation that states the relationship between the cost of a DVD and the total cost of a pack:

cost of DVD * number of DVDs in pack = total cost of pack

We also know that there is a 25 dollar discount on each pack, so we can write that as: 

total cost of pack - 25 = 76

Now we can solve for the total cost of the pack:

total cost of pack = 101

Now we can solve for the cost of one DVD: 

cost of DVD = total cost of pack / number of DVDs in pack

cost of DVD = 101 / number of DVDs in pack

If we plug in the values we know, we get: 

cost of DVD = 101 / 3

cost of DVD = 33.67

697 = number of girls in the school

x = number of boys in the school

So we have the following system of two equations with two unknowns:

x + y = total number of students in the school

y = 697

Solve the system:

x + 697 = total number of students in the school

x = total number of students in the school - 697

x = total number of students in the school - y

Now we have an equation with one unknown:

x = total number of students in the school - 697

We know that there are 228 more girls than boys. So:

228 = y - x

y = x + 228

Now we have two equations with one unknown each. We can solve them:

x + y = total number of students in the school

x + x + 228 = total number of students in the school

2x + 228 = total number of students in the school",( w - x ),469,( 697.0 - 228.0 )

y more girls joined the school. 
That means there are w + y girls in the school. 
z more boys joined the school. 
That means there are x + z boys in the school. 

To find out how many students there are in total, we can add w + y + x + z. 
To find out how many girls there are in total, we can add w + y.",There are w + y girls and x + z boys in the school now.,"There are w girls and x boys in the school.
y more girls join the school.
Now there are w + y girls in the school.

Now there are w + y girls and x + z boys in the school.

The number of girls in the school now is w + y.","There are originally 732 girls. 

Then, 682 more girls join the school. 

So, there are now 732 + 682 = 1,414 girls in the school.","There are 1,414 girls in the school now.","There are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. 

Let's denote the number of girls after the joining by x. We know that:

x = 732 + 682 = 1414

Now we can use the information that 8 more boys joined the school. 

We know that the total number of students in the school is:

x + 761 + 8 = 1414 + 761 + 8 = 2183

Thus, we obtain:

2183 - 8 = 1414

Hence, there are 1414 girls in the school now.",( w + y ),1414,( 732.0 + 682.0 )
18,"First, Danny went to the park and found w bottle caps and x wrappers. 

Next, he brought them home and added them to his collection. 

That means that, before he went to the park, he had y-w bottle caps and z-x wrappers in his collection. 

We are trying to solve for x, so that means that z-x=z. 

Therefore, x=0.",Danny had x wrappers at first.,"We know:
w bottle caps and x wrappers at the park. Now he has y bottle caps and z wrappers in his collection.

We want to know:
How many wrappers did Danny have at first?

We don't know, but we can find out:
y = w + x
z = y - w

We also know that:
z = x - w

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve it:

y = w + x
z = y - w

x = w + z

Danny had x wrappers at first.","Danny has 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers. 

He finds more bottle caps and wrappers, so now he has 17 bottle caps and 57 wrappers. 

To solve this problem, we want to find out how many wrappers Danny had at first. 

We can do this by starting with what we know and working backwards. 

We know that Danny has 57 wrappers now, and we know that he found 30 wrappers. 

So, we can subtract 30 from 57 to find out how many wrappers Danny had at first. 

57 - 30 = 27

Therefore, Danny had 27 wrappers at first.", 22 bottle caps and 30 wrappers.,"Danny's collection at the park:

19,"Paul got a box of w erasers and x crayons for his birthday.

At the end of the school year he only had y crayons left while not having lost a single eraser.

How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?



We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

x - y = more crayons than erasers

Paul had x crayons to start, and he lost y crayons, so he must have x - y crayons left.","There are y crayons and no erasers left, so Paul had more crayons than erasers.","Let's say that Paul had c crayons and e erasers at the beginning of the school year. Then:

c + e = w + x

c - y = e

y = c - e

Now we can solve for c and e:

c = (w + x + y)/2

e = (w + x - y)/2

Plugging in y = c - e yields:

c = (w + x + c - e)/2

2c = w + x + c

c = (w + x)/2

e = w/2 - x/2 + y/2

Now we can solve for y:

y = c - e

y = (w + x)/2 - w/2 + x/2 - y/2

y = 0

Therefore, y = 0, c = (w + x)/2, and e = (w + x)/2. So Paul had the same number of crayons and erasers left at the end of the school year.","First, let's determine how many crayons Paul started with. We know that he ended with 523 crayons, and we know that he lost no erasers, so we can set up the equation: 

 457 + x = 523

x = 523 - 457

x = 66

So Paul started with 457 erasers and 66 crayons. 

Now we need to determine how many crayons he had at the beginning of the school year. We know that he ended with 523 crayons and we know that he started with 66 crayons, so we can set up the equation: 

66 + x = 523

x = 523 - 66

x = 457

So Paul started with 457 crayons at the beginning of the school year. 

Now we need to determine how many erasers he had at the beginning of the school year. We know that he ended with 457 erasers and we know that he started with 457 erasers, so we can set up the equation: 

457 + x = 457

457 + 0 = 457

Therefore, Paul had 0 erasers at the beginning of the", At the end of the school year he had 94 more crayons than erasers.,"$E$ = number of erasers
$C$ = number of crayons
$e$ = number of erasers spent
$c$ = number of crayons spent

$E$ + $C$ = 1074 
$E$ - $e$ = 457 
$C$ - $c$ = 523 
$e$ + $c$ = 580

1074 = 457 + 523

This can be represented as follows:

Now he has y bottle caps and z wrappers in his collection. 

This means that the number of bottle caps he has in his collection, y, is z more than the number of wrappers he has in his collection, z. 

Now we need to compare x to y and w to z. 

x is w more than y and w is z more than z. 

This means that x is z more than y. 

Therefore, Danny found z more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.","Danny found w wrappers and x bottle caps at the park. Now he has y bottle caps and z wrappers in his collection.

Danny found x - y more bottle caps than wrappers at the park.","Let's say Danny found b bottle caps and w wrappers at the park. 

Now he has y bottle caps and z wrappers in his collection. 

We know that:

y = x + b

z = w + b

We need to find b. 

We can do that by subtracting x from both sides of the first equation:

y - x = b

Now we can substitute y - x for b in the second equation:

z = w + (y - x)

We can simplify the equation:

z - y = w - x

We know that z - y = wrappers - bottle caps. 

Therefore:

wrappers - bottle caps = w - x

We need to find w - x. 

We can do that by subtracting w from both sides of the equation:

wrappers - w = - x

We can simplify the equation:

wrappers - w - wrappers = - x - wrappers

We can simplify the equation further:

- w = - x - wrappers

We can add w to both sides of the equation","Danny found 46 wrappers and 50 bottle caps at the park. 

Then, he had 21 bottle caps and 52 wrappers in his collection. 

We want to know how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park.

This gives us the equation:

The sum of two numbers is equal to the difference between the larger number and the smaller number plus the smaller number:

3 cups of flour have already been added to the cake mixture
11 cups of sugar are called for in the recipe
and we need to add 6 more cups of flour

So we set up the equation:

x = 11 + 6 - 3 

Therefore, the recipe requires 14 cups of flour in total.",( x + y ),9,( 3.0 + 6.0 )

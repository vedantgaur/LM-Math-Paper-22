Then we have $h_D = x + h_R$ and $d = w \cdot h_D$. 

Substituting the first equation into the second, we get $d = w \cdot (x + h_R)$.

Therefore, the answer is w - y.",Danny had x wrappers at first.,"Let's say that the number of wrappers Danny had at first was w. 

After he found x wrappers at the park, he had w + x wrappers in total.

We also know that he had w erasers at the beginning of the school year and w erasers at the end of the school year. 

This means that he had x - y more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.","First, we'll figure out how many crayons Paul started with. We know that he got 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday. So, we can say that:

Next, we'll figure out how many crayons Paul had at the end of the school year. We know that he had 523 crayons left, and we also know that he didn't lose any erasers. So, we can say that: 

457 erasers + 523 crayons = 980 total

Now, we have enough information to solve the problem. We know that Paul started with 1074 total items, and he ended with 980 total items. So, we can say that: 

1074 total items - 980 total items = 94

At the end of the school year he only had $523$ crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. So at the end of the school year he had $523$ crayons and $457$ erasers in total. 

We can write this information as a system of equations: 

$x + 617 = 523 + 457$

$x = 974$

So Paul had $974$ crayons at the beginning of the school year. 

Now we can calculate how many more crayons than erasers he had left. He had $523$ crayons and $457$ erasers left, so he had $523 - 457 = 66$ more crayons than erasers left.",( y - w ),66,( 523.0 - 457.0 )

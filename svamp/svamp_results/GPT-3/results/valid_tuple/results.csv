then we can say that he found 27 bottle caps at the park.",Danny found 27 bottle caps at the park.
6,"Danny has 2 bottle caps in his collection. 
He found some more bottle caps at the park. 

We can say that he found some more bottle caps, which means that he found more than 2 bottle caps. 

We can also say that he found some more bottle caps, which means that he found more than 0 bottle caps. 

We also know that he has 35 bottle caps now, which means that he found 33 bottle caps at the park.",Danny found 33 bottle caps at the park.
7,"Danny has 13 bottle caps in his collection. 
He found some more bottle caps at the park. 

We want to know how many bottle caps he found at the park. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem: 

13 + x = 35

We want to know what x is equal to. 

We can solve this equation by subtracting 13 from each side: 

13 + x = 35
-13 -13
0 + x = 22

We can see that x is equal to 22. 

Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park.",Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park.

9,"Danny has 8 bottle caps in his collection. 
He found some more bottle caps at the park. 

We want to know how many bottle caps he found at the park. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem: 

8 + x = 12 

We want to solve for x, which is how many bottle caps he found at the park. 

We can solve this equation by using inverse operations. We want to move everything except for x to one side. 

To do this, we can add -8 to each side. 

8 + x = 12 
8 + x - 8 = 12 - 8 

Now we have: 

x = 4 

Danny found 4 bottle caps at the park.",Danny found 4 bottle caps at the park.
10,"Dan has $16. 
He buys candy bars for $4 each. 
That means that each candy bar costs $4. 

Now we can set up an equation: 

16 = 4x 

We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 4: 

16/4 = 4x/4 

4 = x 

That means that Dan bought 4 candy bars.",Dan bought 4 candy bars.
11,"Dan has $46. 
He buys candy bars for $24. 
Each candy bar costs $1. 

How many candy bars did he buy? 

We can solve this problem by using division. We know that he has $46, and we know that he spent $24 on candy bars. So if we divide $24 by $46, we will know how many candy bars he bought. 

$24/$46 = x 

We can solve for x by using inverse operations. In this case, we will divide both sides by $24$. 

$24/$46 = x 
$24/x = 46$ 
$1/x = 46/24$ 
$x = 24/46$ 

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2. 

$x = 12/23$ 

This means that Dan bought 12 candy bars.",Dan bought 24 candy bars.
12,"Dan has $47. 
He buys candy bars for $40 each. 
Each candy bar costs $8. 

How many candy bars did he buy? 

We can solve this problem by using algebra. We'll set up an equation and solve for the variable. 

We know that Dan has $47, and we know that he spends $40 on candy bars. We also know that each candy bar costs $8. So we can set up the equation: 

47 = 40 + 8x

We can solve this equation by subtracting 40 from both sides. This will give us: 

7 = 8x

We can solve this equation by dividing both sides by 8. This will give us: 

x = 7/8

This means that Dan bought 7/8 candy bars, or 7 candy bars.",Dan bought 5 candy bars.
13,"Dan has $33. 
He buys candy bars for $32 each. 
Each candy bar costs $1. 

We want to know how many candy bars he bought. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem: 

$33 = $32x + $1x

$33 = $32x + $1x
$33 - $1x = $32x
$1x = $33 - $32x
$1x = $1(33 - 32x)
$1x = $1(33 - $32x)
$1x = $1($33 - $32x)

Baker sold 14 more cakes than those he bought.",Baker sold 12 more cakes than those he bought.
22,"Baker made 45 cakes. He sold 47 of them and bought 12 new cakes. 

First, we need to figure out how many cakes Baker had in total. To do this, we can add the number of cakes he made to the number of cakes he bought. So we have: 

45 + 12 = 57

This means that, in total, Baker had 57 cakes. 

Next, we need to figure out how many cakes Baker sold. To do this, we can subtract the number of cakes he had in total from the number of cakes he sold. So we have:

p = w - x.

Now we can substitute the value of p into the original equation and solve it for w:

We are told that Paco had w salty cookies and x sweet cookies. He ate y sweet cookies and z salty cookies. The question is asking how many salty cookies Paco had left. 

We can set up an equation to solve this problem. 

w + x = the total number of cookies Paco had
y + z = the total number of cookies Paco ate

If we subtract y + z from both sides of the equation, we get: 

w + x - y - z = the total number of cookies Paco had - the total number of cookies Paco ate 

w + x - y - z = the number of cookies Paco had left

Therefore, the answer to the question is w + x - y - z.",Paco had w salty cookies and x sweet cookies. He ate y sweet cookies and z salty cookies.

Paco started with 10 cookies.

Now we need to figure out how many y is. We are given that y is 2/3 of x. 

That means y/x = 2/3. Cross multiply to get 3y = 2x. 

That means y = 2/3x. 

Now we can plug this value of y into our original equation: x-y = x-2/3x. 

Simplify to get x/3 = x-2x/3. 

Add 2x/3 to both sides to get 5x/3 = x. 

Divide both sides by 5/3 to get x = 3.

First, we need to figure out how many children got on the bus. We can do this by looking at the equation: 

new passengers = old passengers + passengers getting on - passengers getting off 

There are 60 old passengers, and we know that the equation equals 84. So, we can set up the equation like this: 

60 + x - y = 84 

We also know that there are more passengers getting on the bus than passengers getting off. So, that means that x is going to be greater than y. We can represent this by saying that x - y is positive. 

Now, we can solve for x. 

60 + x - y = 84 
60 + x - y + y = 84 + y 
60 + x = 84 + y 
x = 84 + y - 60

In order to solve a proportional relationship, we need to find two known values. In this case, we know that Dean is x feet taller than Ron, and we know that the depth of the water is w times Dean's height. We can set up a proportion as follows:

Now we have an equation that allows us to calculate the depth of the water. All we need is to know the values ​​of the variables x and y.

Let's substitute the known values ​​into the equation and calculate the depth of the water:

w = x - y

w = 7 - 5

w = 2

That is, the depth of the water is 2 feet.","
The water was 10 meters deep.","There is no definitive answer to this question as the depth of the water would likely vary depending on the location. In general, however, it is safe to say that the water would have been at least several feet deep in order to accommodate the large number of ships that were involved in the Battle of the Atlantic.","Let's denote the depth of the water by $d$. The depth of the water is equal to the height of the container $h$ minus the height of the object $x$:
$$d = h - x$$
The volume of the water $V$ is equal to the product of the water's depth $d$, the length of the container $l$ and its width $w$:
$$V = d\cdot l \cdot w$$
We know that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their reciprocals. Thus, we can write:
$$V = \frac{l\cdot w}{h-x}$$
We know that the volume of the water is equal to the product of its width $w$ and its height $y$. Thus, we can write:
$$V = w\cdot y$$
From the last two equations we obtain:
$$\frac{l\cdot w}{h-x} = w\cdot y$$
After cancelling out $w$ from both sides of the equation we get:
$$\frac{l}{h-x} = y$$
We know that the height of the object $",( ( x + y ) * w ),255.0,( ( 4.0 + 13.0 ) * 15.0 ),( y - w ),66,( 523.0 - 457.0 )

So, now we have w+x birds on the fence. y more storks joined them. So, now we have w+x+y birds on the fence.","
There are 3 sections to the fence, and 2 birds on each section. 

So, in total, there are 6 birds on the fence.",There is no way to determine how many birds are sitting on the fence without further information.,"There are $x$ birds sitting on the fence.

There are $y$ birds in the trees.

There are $z$ birds on the ground.

There are $100$ birds in total.

So we have the equation:

$$x+y+z=100$$

From the second statement we know that:

$$y=3x$$

Substituting it into the first equation we get:

$$x+3x+z=100$$

$$4x+z=100$$

From the third statement we know that:

$$z=4x$$

Substituting it into the equation we get:

$$4x+4x=100$$

$$8x=100$$

$$x=\frac{100}{8}=12.5$$

1. Marco and his dad went strawberry picking. Together they collected strawberries that weighed w pounds. 
2. On the way back Marco's dad lost x pounds of strawberries. 
3. Marco's strawberries now weighed y pounds. 

Now we can answer the question. How much did his dad's strawberries weigh now? 

3. His dad's strawberries now weigh w-x pounds.",The weight of Marco's dad's strawberries now would be w - x pounds.,"Let's say that Marco and his dad picked up w pounds of strawberries together. Then dad lost x pounds of strawberries on the way back, which means that Marco's strawberries now weigh w - x pounds. The question is, how many pounds of strawberries did dad have left? Well, this is exactly what we need to find out, so let's call it y.

Now we have the equation:

w - x = y

which can be rewritten as:

y = w - x","irst, we need to find out how many strawberries there are in total. His dad started with 10 strawberries, and then he picked 5 more. So there are 15 strawberries in total. Now, we need to convert that number of strawberries into pounds. We know that 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, and we also know that 1 ounce is equal to about 28 strawberries. So, 16 ounces = 28 strawberries. Then, we can set up a proportion to solve for the number of pounds of strawberries.

15 strawberries = x pounds

28 strawberries = 1 pound

We can cross multiply to solve for x.

15 * 1 = x * 28
15 = 28x
1/15 = x/28
x = 1/15 pounds

So, the answer is that there are 1/15 pounds of strawberries.",His dad's strawberries weighed 3 pounds.,"We have:

strawberries1 kg * 2.5 price = $

strawberries2 kg * 2.5 price = $

Now we can introduce an intermediate variable y - the number of kilograms of strawberries sold by the father:

y kg * 2.5 price = $

Now we can write two equations and solve them:

The number of girls in the school now is w + y.

z more boys joined the school.

The number of boys in the school now is x + z.

The total number of students in the school now is w + y + x + z.

We know that w + y + x + z = w + x + y + z.

Therefore, w + y = w + x + y + z - (x + z) = w + x + y + z - x - z = w + y + z.

The number of girls in the school now is w + y = w + y + z - z = w + y + z - (x + z) + (x + z) - z = w + y + z - z + x + z = w + y + 2x + z.","

We are given that:
$$x_1 = \frac{1}{3}x_0$$
$$x_2 = \frac{1}{3}x_1$$

$$x_1 = \frac{1}{3}x_0$$
$$x_2 = \frac{1}{3^2}x_0$$
$$x_3 = \frac{1}{3^3}x_0$$

We want to find $x_0$, so we can solve for it:

We also know that he started with w erasers and x crayons. This means that at some point during the school year, he must have had w erasers and x crayons. 

Now, we can set up the equation w + x = y. This equation says that the total number of erasers and crayons he started with is equal to the total number of crayons he had at the end of the year. 

From here, we can solve for x. We know that w + x = y and w = 0. This means that x = y. Therefore, Paul had y more crayons than erasers at the end of the year.",y - x,"Paul got a box of w erasers and x crayons for his birthday.

Let's introduce the number of erasers and crayons that he had at the beginning of the school year:

At the end of the school year he only had y crayons left while not having lost a single eraser. How many more crayons than erasers did he have left?

e_1 - number of erasers at the end of the school year,
c_1 - number of crayons at the end of the school year.

We know that:

c_0 - y = 0.

From the condition of the problem we can conclude that:

e_1 = e_0,
c_1 = c_0 - y.

We also know that:

e_0 = w - x,
c_0 = x.

Now we can find c_1:

First, we need to subtract the number of erasers he had from the total number of crayons to find out how many crayons he had left.

94 - 24 = 

70

So, he had 70 crayons left.","If he had two fewer crayons than erasers, that would mean he had an equal number of each. Two fewer crayons than erasers would also mean he had two more erasers than crayons.","

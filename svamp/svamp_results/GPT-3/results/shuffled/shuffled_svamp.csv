0,"There are 3 pizzas. 
Each pizza has the same number of slices. 
There are a total of 38 slices. 

We can set this up as an equation: 

3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices

We can solve for the number of slices/pizza: 

3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices
3 pizzas * _____ slices/pizza = 38 slices

1,"Danny found 3 wrappers and 6 bottle caps at the park. 
Now he has 13 bottle caps and 17 wrappers in his collection.

We can see that Danny has a total of 13 + 6 = 19 bottle caps and a total of 3 + 17 = 20 wrappers. 

We're looking for how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny found at the park, so we want to know how many more bottle caps Danny has than wrappers. 

We can find this out by subtracting the total number of wrappers from the total number of bottle caps: 

19 - 20 = -1

45,"2 feet wide means that her room is 2 feet wide for every 1 foot long. 

309 feet long means that her room is 309 feet long for every 1 foot wide. 

To compare the two, we need to find a common unit. In this case, let's use inches. 

2 feet = 24 inches 
309 feet = 3696 inches 

24 inches is the width of her room for every 3696 inches long. 

To find how many times wider her room is than it is long, we can divide 24 by 3696. 

24/3696 = 1/154 

This means that for every 1 inch wide, her room is 154 inches long. 

To find how many more inches her room is long than it is wide, we can multiply 1/154 by 3696. 

1/154 * 3696 = 24

46,"1) The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $6 dollars off each t-shirt sold. 
2) During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they made $10 by selling t-shirts. 
3) How many t-shirts did they sell?

To solve this problem, we need to figure out how many t-shirts were sold at $6 each. We can do this by dividing the total amount of money made ($10) by the amount of money made per t-shirt ($6).

1,The candy bar cost him x.,x - w = cost,$$c = 2w - x$$
2, w - z = the number of salty cookies Paco had left., w - z = the number of salty cookies Paco had left., w - z = how many salty cookies did Paco have left
3,w - x = how many children got off the bus., w - x, x = w - (w - x) which is equivalent to x = w/2 .
4,"y - x = w + x - x

or simply 

w",x - (w + x - y) = y - w.,x - z = y - w
5,x - y = z - w,"w + x - x > 0

or

w > 0",x.
6,y + w,x + w - w = x,$$a = x - b$$
7,y-(w-x), y-x., w - (x + y) = 0.

13,1/(1+x/y),w(x+y),w*(y-x+x)=w*y
14,w + x + y, w + x + y ., w + x + y.
15,x = w - y, w - x = y,y
16, w - x = the total number of boys in the school., w - x., 2w + x = boys.
17, w + y + x + z = w + y.,"w + y = Girls

x + z = Boys", w + y.
18,0,x = w + y - z,x = w + z
19,x - y, y>0,y = 0

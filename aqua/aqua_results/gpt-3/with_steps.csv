0,"At a 15% faster rate, Friend P will walk 4.35 km more than Friend Q in the first hour. 

In the second hour, Friend P will walk an additional 4.35 km, for a total of 8.7 km. 

Friend Q will have walked 7.5 km in the first two hours. 

In the third hour, Friend P will have walked an additional 4.35 km, for a total of 13.05 km. 

Friend Q will have walked 11.25 km in the first three hours. 

In the fourth hour, Friend P will have walked an additional 4.35 km, for a total of 17.4 km. 

Friend Q will have walked 15 km in the first four hours. 

In the fifth hour, Friend P will have walked an additional 4.35 km, for a total of 21.75 km. 

Friend Q will have walked 18.75 km in the first five hours.

Therefore, Friend P will have walked 21.75 km when they pass Friend Q.","43 km * .15 = 6.45 km

43 km - 6.45 km = 36.55 km

36.55 km / 2 = 18.275 km","The answer is D) 22.5 kilometers. 

To solve this problem, we need to set up a proportion. 

First, we know that Friend P is walking 15% faster than Friend Q. We can write this as a ratio: 

Friend P's speed:Friend Q's speed = 3:2

Next, we need to find the total time it will take for both friends to walk the entire 43 kilometers. We can set up another ratio to find this: 

Distance:Rate = Time 

We know that Friend P is walking 3 kilometers for every 2 kilometers that Friend Q walks. We can set this up as a proportion: 

3km:2km = x:43km 

We can solve for x by cross multiplying: 

2x = 129 

x = 64.5 

This means that it will take Friend P 64.5 minutes to walk the 43 kilometers. 

Now that we know the total time it will take to walk the entire distance, we can set up another proportion to find how many kilometers Friend P will have walked when they pass Friend Q. 

Distance:Time = Rate 

","To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion. We know that Friend P walks 15% faster than Friend Q, so we can set up the proportion:

$$\frac{x}{43}=\frac{15}{100}+\frac{x}{43}$$

We can solve this equation for x to find that x=21.5 kilometers. This means that when Friend P and Friend Q pass each other, Friend P will have walked 21.5 kilometers.",P will have walked 21.5 km when they pass Q.,"Let x represent Friend Q's rate.

We know that Friend Q's rate is 15% slower than Friend P's, so:

x + 0.15x = 15

1.15x = 15

x = 15/1.15

x = 13

We also know that Friend P is walking at a rate of 15% faster than Friend Q, so:

x + 0.15x = 15

1.15x = 15

x = 15/1.15

x = 13

Now we can set up the equation:

43/x + 43/(x + 0.15x) = 43/13 + 43/(13 + 0.15(13))

43/x + 43/(x + 1.95x) = 43/13 + 43/(13 + 2.445)

We can simplify each fraction on the left side:

43/x + 43/x(1 + 1.95) = 43/13 + 43/13(1 + 2.445)

43/x + 43/x(1.95 + 1) = 43/13 + 43/13(2.445",A)21,"We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. Let's call the distance that Friend P has walked x, and the distance that Friend Q has walked y. Then,

15/100 * x = y

We can solve for y:

y = 15/100 * x

Now, we know that the total distance of the trail is 43 km. This means that:

x + y = 43

We can substitute y in for 15/100 * x and solve for x:

x + 15/100 * x = 43

x + 15/100x = 43

x(1 + 15/100) = 43

x = 43 / (1 + 15/100)

x = approximately 41.86 km

This means that when Friend P has walked 41.86 km, they will pass Friend Q.","43 km * 0.15 = 6.45 km

43 km - 6.45 km = 36.55 km

36.55 km / 2 = 18.275 km","Step 1: Find the ratio between the two rates.
15% faster than Friend Q's means the rate is 1.15 times as fast.

Step 2: Set up a proportion using the ratio and the total distance.

The man's speed in still water is 25 kmph.

The speed of the current is 11 kmph.

The man's speed in the current is therefore (25 + 11) kmph, or 36 kmph.

To cover 80 metres in 18 seconds, the man would need to be travelling at (80 / 18) m/s, or 4.44 m/s.

To solve this, we need to use the algebraic method of solving inequalities.

First, we'll start by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 5:

Next, we'll need to simplify the left side of the inequality:

The slope of line k is 1/5. This means that for every unit increase in the x-coordinate, the y-coordinate will increase by 1/5. 

Since line k passes through the origin, this means that the point (0,0) is also on line k. 

We know that the point (5, y) is on line k. This means that y = 5(1/5) + 0. 

y = 1 + 0 

y = 1 

We also know that the point (x, 1) is on line k. This means that 1 = 5(1/5)x + 0.

The interest on a loan is typically compounded quarterly, meaning that every three months the interest that has accrued is added to the principal of the loan. This means that Carl would pay 4% interest every three months, or 1% interest per month. On a $10,000 loan, this would come out to $100 per month, or $2150 per year.","The approximate interest Carl pays annually is $2000. This is because the quarterly compound rate of 4% would result in an annual compound rate of 16%. Therefore, the interest Carl pays annually would be $1600 + $400 = $2000.","The answer is C)$2150.

The quarterly compound rate of 4% is equivalent to an annual compound rate of 16%. This means that the interest Carl pays on his loan each year is 1.6% of the loan's principal, or $160.","B)$2000 The quarterly compound rate of 4% would equal an annual compound rate of 16%. This means that for every $10,000 Carl borrows, he would owe $1600 in interest each quarter, or a total of $6400 each year.","B)$2000

The interest on a loan is typically charged quarterly, meaning that there are four equal payments throughout the year. If the quarterly compound rate is 4%, then the annual compound rate would be 16%. However, Carl is only paying the interest on the loan, so he would only be paying 1/4 of the annual compound rate. Therefore, the annual interest he pays would be 1/4 of 16%, or 4%. 4% of $10,000 is $400, so the quarterly interest payments would be $100 each. There are four quarters in a year, so the total annual interest Carl pays would be $400.","The approximate interest that Carl pays annually is $2000.

To solve this inequality, we need to use the concept of division of algebraic expressions. We can divide both sides of the inequality by 5 to get:

(x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 â‰¤ (x + 1)/5

After division, we can simplify the left side to get:

x^2/5 + 4x/5 - 11/5 â‰¤ x/5 + 1/5

We can further simplify the left side to get:

(x^2 + 4x)/5 - 11/5 â‰¤ x + 1/5

Now we need to solve for x. We can start by adding 11/5 to both sides of the inequality to get:

(x^2 + 4x)/5 â‰¤ x + 12/5

Next, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 5 to get:

x^2 + 4x â‰¤ 5x + 12

Now we can subtract 4x from both sides of the inequality to get:

x^2 â‰¤ x + 12

x^2 - 6x - 12 â‰¤ 0

Which is a quadratic equation in standard form. We can use the quadratic equation to solve for x, and we get:

x = 3 Â± âˆš33

To solve this inequality, we need to use the algebraic method. We start by subtracting x from both sides, which gives us:

(x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 - x â‰¤ 1

Then, we need to factor the left side. We can factor it as:

(x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 - x = (x(x + 4) - 11)/5 - x

= (x(x + 4) - 11 - 5x)/5

= (x(x + 4) - 16)/5

To solve this inequality, we need to use the distributive property to simplify the left side. This gives us:

(x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 - x - 1 â‰¤ 0

Next, we use the fact that when we're solving for an inequality, we can add or subtract the same thing on both sides without changing the inequality. So we add 1 to both sides, which gives us:

(x^2 + 4x - 10)/5 - x â‰¤ 0

Now we use the fact that when we're solving for an inequality, we can multiply or divide both sides by the same thing without changing the inequality. So we multiply both sides by 5, which gives us:

x^2 + 4x - 10 â‰¤ 0

Now we can solve this quadratic inequality using the quadratic formula. We get:

x â‰¤ -2 or x â‰¥ 5

So our solution set is:

{x | x â‰¤ -2 or x â‰¥ 5}

Which is the same as saying:

To find the solution, we need to solve the inequality for x. We can do this by subtracting 1 from both sides and then multiplying both sides by 5. This gives us:

5(x^2 + 4x - 11)/5 â‰¤ 5(x + 1)

Simplifying this gives us:

x^2 + 4x - 11 â‰¤ 5x + 5

We can now solve this inequality for x. We do this by subtracting 5x from both sides and then adding 11 to both sides. This gives us:

x^2 - x - 6 â‰¤ 0

We can now use the Quadratic Formula to solve this inequality for x. This gives us:

The simple interest formula is I = Prt, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, and t is the time in years.

In this case, we are given that I = 956 and t = 3, so we can solve for P:

956 = 825r(3)

956 = 2475r

r = 0.0388, or 3.88%.

If we increase the interest rate by 4%, the new interest rate will be 3.88% + 4% = 7.88%.

Plugging this into the simple interest formula, we get:

I = Prt

I = 825(0.0788)(3)

I = 1020.80","The new rate of interest will be 12% (8% + 4%).

The new amount after 3 years will be:

825 * (1.12)^3 = 1055","The answer is Rs. 1020.80.

This can be calculated by finding the amount of interest that would be accrued at the 4% rate and adding it to the original principal. The amount of interest would be:

0.04 * 825 * 3 = 99.60

Therefore, the total amount after three years would be:

825 + 99.60 = 924.60

The new amount after increasing the rate by 4% would be:

0.04 * 924.60 * 3 = 109.76

Therefore, the total amount after three years would be:

924.60 + 109.76 = 1034.36

Rounding this up to the nearest cent gives us Rs. 1020.80.","The answer is B) Rs. 1025. 

The reason is that when the rate of interest is increased by 4%, the new rate of interest will be 8% (the original rate plus the 4% increase). 

Therefore, using the formula for simple interest, I = Prt, where I is the interest, P is the principal, r is the rate, and t is the time in years, we get: 

I = 825(0.08)(3) = Rs. 20 

Therefore, the new amount after 3 years will be: 

825 + 20 = Rs. 845 

However, since we are dealing with compound interest, we need to use the formula: 

A = P(1 + r/n)nt

where A is the new amount, P is the principal, r is the rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is the time in years. 

In this case, n = 4, because interest is compounded quarterly. Therefore, the new amount will be: 

825(1 + 0.08/4)4(3) = Rs. 1025",The amount of Rs. 825 will become Rs. 1020.80 in 3 years if the rate of interest is increased by 4%.,"The answer is B) Rs. 1025.

The answer is D)4/2 because when you plug in the numbers for a/b and 8a+5b, you get 16/8+20/4 which then cancels out to 4/2.","The answer is 3/2.

We are given that a/b=3/4 and 8a+5b=22. We can solve this system of equations by substitution.

We know that a/b=3/4, so a=3b/4. We can substitute this into our other equation:

8(3b/4)+5b=22

8(3b/4)+5b=22

24b/4+5b=22

24b/4+5b=22

29b/4=22

29b/4=22

29b/4*4/29=22*4/29

b=8

Now we can plug b=8 back into a=3b/4 to solve for a:

a=3(8)/4

a=24/4

a=24/4

a=6

Therefore, the answer is 3/2.","A)1/2 
The answer is 1/2 because if you plug in 1/2 for a/b in the equation 8a+5b=22, you get 8(1/2)+5(1/2)=4+2.5=6.5, which is not equal to 22.","A)1/2 

The answer is 1/2 because if you divide both sides of the equation by 2, you are left with a/b=3/4.","The answer is D)4/2.

If a/b=3/4, then we can multiply both sides by 4 to get 4a/4b=3/4*4, or a/b=3.

If 8a+5b=22, then we can subtract 5b from both sides to get 8a=22-5b.

We can now plug this value for a into our equation for a/b to get:

4(22-5b)/4b=3

88-20b)/4b=3

We can now subtract 88 from both sides and divide by -20 to get:

We can solve this equation by multiplying both sides by 4 to clear the fraction on the left side. This gives us 32a + 20b = 88. Now we can subtract 20b from both sides to get 32a = 68. Finally, we can divide both sides by 32 to get a = 68/32. This can be simplified to a = 2.125, which is closer to A)1/2 than any of the other answer choices.","The answer is D)4/2.

We can solve this equation by plugging in the known values and solving for a. We know that a/b=3/4, so we can substitute 3a/4 for a in the equation 8a+5b=22. This gives us 8(3a/4)+5b=22. We can then simplify this equation to 6a+5b=22. Now we can solve for a by subtracting 5b from both sides, which gives us 6a=17. Finally, we can divide both sides by 6 to solve for a, and we get a=4/2.","A)1/2 
The given equation can be rewritten as 8(a/b)+5=22. Since a/b=3/4, we can plug this value in for a/b to get 8(3/4)+5=22. This equation can further be simplified to 6+5=22. Therefore, a=1/2.","A)1/2

The answer is 1/2 because if you multiply both sides of the equation by 2, you get 2(8a+5b)=2*22, or 16a+10b=44. This can be rewritten as 16a=44-10b, or a=(44-10b)/16. Plugging in the values for a/b and b, you get (44-10(3/4))/16, which simplifies to 1/2.","Given that a/b = 3/4, we can set up the equation 4a/4b = 3/4. We can then multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fractions. This gives us the equation 4a = 3b. 

We are also given that 8a + 5b = 22. We can subtract 5b from both sides to get 8a = 22 - 5b. 

Now that we have two equations, we can set them equal to each other and solve for a.

We can then find the total income of the wealthiest 10 customers by multiplying the average income of the wealthiest 10 customers ($95,000) by 10. This gives us a total income of $950,000.

To find the average income of the other 40 customers, we can take the total income of all 50 customers and subtract the total income of the wealthiest 10 customers.

Reasoning:

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of three numbers is 351 to solve for one of the numbers, say x. We have:

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 351

x^2 = 351 - y^2 - z^2

x = sqrt(351 - y^2 - z^2)

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the products of two of the numbers is 245 to solve for another number, say y. We have:

xy + yz + zx = 245

xy = 245 - yz - zx

y(x + z) = 245 - zx

y = (245 - zx)/(x + z)

Plugging in our expression for x, we have:

y = (245 - zx)/(sqrt(351 - y^2 - z^2) + z)

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the three numbers is 25 to solve for the last number, say z. We have:

x + y + z = 25

z","The answer is D)26.

The sum of the squares of three numbers is 351. This means that the sum of the products of two of those numbers is 245. The sum of the products of two of the numbers is equal to the sum of the squares of the two numbers minus the square of the third number.

Therefore, the sum of the products of two of the numbers is equal to 351 - the square of the third number.

The square of the third number is 9, so the sum of the products of two of the numbers is 351 - 9, or 342.

The sum of the three numbers is the sum of the products of two of the numbers plus the third number. Therefore, the sum of the three numbers is 342 + 3, or 26.",C)25 The sum of the squares is 351. The sum of the products taken two at a time is 245. The sum of the numbers is 25.,B) 22,C) 25,"The answer is C) 25. 

The sum of the squares of three numbers is 351. This can be rewritten as: 

3^2 + x^2 + y^2 = 351 

The sum of their products taken two at a time is 245. This can be rewritten as: 

3xy + xy = 245 

From the first equation, we can solve for x^2: 

x^2 = 351 - 3^2 - y^2 

Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 

3xy + xy = 245 
xy(3 + 1) = 245 
xy = 245/(3 + 1) 
xy = 80 

From the first equation, we can solve for y^2: 

y^2 = 351 - 3^2 - x^2 

Substituting this into the second equation and solving for y, we get: 

y = sqrt(245/3 - 3) 
y = 5

The area of a square is calculated by A = s^2, where s is the length of a side. If we increase each side by 25%, s = 1.25s. Therefore, the new area is A = (1.25s)^2 = 1.5625s^2. The percentage change in area is therefore (1.5625s^2 - s^2)/s^2 * 100 = 56.25%.",C) 65,"C) 65%

The area of a square is calculated by multiplying the length of one side by itself. If each side is increased by 25%, the new length of each side is 1.25 times the original length. The area of the new square is therefore 1.25 times 1.25, or 1.5625, times the original area. This is an increase of 56.25%.",B)56.25

The value of the investment after 10 years is $973.25. This is because the interest rate is 5% and it compounds monthly.","The value of the investment after 10 years is $1100.00.

The interest rate is 5% per year, which is 0.42% per month. 

The value of the investment after 10 years is $1100.00.","The value of the investment after 10 years is C)$973.25.

The value of the investment can be calculated using the formula:

A = P(1 + r/n)nt

Where:

A is the future value of the investment
P is the present value of the investment
r is the annual interest rate
n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year
t is the number of years the money is invested

For this problem, we have:

A = P(1 + r/n)nt
A = 500(1 + 0.05/12)12(10)
A = 500(1.00416667)120
A = 973.25","The value of the investment after 10 years is $1100.00. This is because the interest rate is compounded monthly, so the interest earned each month is added to the account balance. The account balance will therefore grow at a faster rate than if the interest were not compounded.","D)$1000.25

The value of the investment after 10 years is $1000.25. This is because the interest rate is 5% and it compounds monthly.","The correct answer is C)$973.25.

If $500 is deposited into a savings account at an annual interest rate of 5% that compounds monthly, the value of the investment after 10 years would be $973.25. This is because the interest rate is compounded monthly, so the interest earned would be added to the account each month and would then earn interest itself. Over 10 years, this would compound to create a larger amount than if the interest were not compounded monthly.","The value of the investment after 10 years is $1100.00.
